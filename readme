The recordings used for the figure "AXI Read Jitter and Peaks" are taken from
TEST__MemoryReaderDDR__firstAddress=00080010-lastAddress=00080F10-step=00000008-repetitions=00000000-repetitionGap=00000040__run=XXXX_of_1000.ila
with XXX running from 1 to 1000.

The read/write test is "TEST__TableWriter*.ila
The read test is TEST__MemoryReader*.ila
The write test is TEST_MemoryWriter*.ila


DDR/OCM refer to the memory type used (which directly corresponds to differen address ranges)
The address range used for the test ist given by "firstAddress" and "lastAddress".
"step" is the step width while iterating through the address range.

Repetitions refers to additional repetitions (for example, the whole range is read 5 times). RepetitionGap is the pause between repetitions.

run=X of Y is the id of the individual test run.


All tests were performed on a PYNQ-Z1 board running at 77 MHz, while the CPU was running an empty while(1){} loop.

The csv files were directly extracted from the .ila files provided by Xilinx Vivado 2022.2 without any postprocessing.
